# Installation

There are two steps to installing Odin:
1. [Odin Engine, MongoDB and Odin CLI](https://github.com/theycallmemac/odin/blob/master/INSTALL.md#1-odin-engine-mongodb-and-odin-cli)
2. [Odin Observability Dashboard](https://github.com/theycallmemac/odin/blob/master/INSTALL.md#2-odin-observability-dashboard)
3. [Odin Software Development Kits](https://github.com/theycallmemac/odin/blob/master/INSTALL.md#3-odin-software-development-kits)

After completing these steps you will be ready to consult [the documentation](https://github.com/theycallmemac/odin/blob/final-year-project/docs/documentation/Odin-User-Manual.pdf) to start using Odin!

## 0. Requirements

- Ubuntu Linux
- [Go Tools](https://golang.org/doc/install#install)


## 1. Odin Engine, MongoDB and Odin CLI

First off, before building the project, we must first clone the repository via HTTPS with the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/theycallmemac/odin.git 
```

Then we build and install (as the root user):

```
cd odin

sudo make
```

We can verify all components were successfully install with the following series of commands:
```
systemctl status odin

systemctl status mongod

odin --help
```

### The Makefile

To build the project, we can consult the Makefile in the project root directory. This file will automate the installation of the:
- Odin Engine
- Odin CLI
- MongoDB instance

Along with this, the Odin Engine will be run as a systemd service and the Odin CLI will be universally accessible from the `/bin` directory.

To utilise this automation we must run the makefile as the root user as so with the make command. This will:
- build the Odin Engine
- build the Odin CLI
- move the `odin-engine/config/odin-config.yml` file to the root user home directory
- move the generated CLI and Engine binary to the `/bin` directory
- move the `odin-engine/init/odin.service` file to `/lib/systemd/system` so it can be run as a systemd service
- install a locally accessible MongoDB
- creates the odin group, which users must be a member of to use the system.

Itâ€™s also advisable to set the following two environment variables for the Odin Engine to use:

```
export ODIN_EXEC_ENV=True
export ODIN_MONGODB="mongodb://localhost:27017"
```

## 2. Odin Observability Dashboard

To set up the Odin Observability Dashboard, just run the following command in both the `odin-dashboard/client` and `odin-dashboard/server` directory to install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

In the `odin-dashboard/client` directory, you can run: 

`npm install -g @angular/cli@latest`

This will install the latest version of the Angular CLI tool. To make the user interface accessible at `http://localhost:4200`, just run:

```
ng serve
```

In the `odin-dashboard/server` directory just run:

```
npm start
```

This will start up the backend server for the dashboard. This server will start listening on port 3000 and will be accessible at http://localhost:3000. 


## 3. Odin Software Development Kits

Currently there are three Odin SDKs available:

- Go

  ```go get github.com/theycallmemac/odin/odin-libraries/go/odinlib```

- Python

  ```pip install pyodin```

- Node.js

  ```npm install odinlib```

Please consult [the Odin SDK documentation](https://github.com/theycallmemac/odin/blob/master/DOCS.md#4-the-odin-software-development-kits) for a guide on how they are used.
